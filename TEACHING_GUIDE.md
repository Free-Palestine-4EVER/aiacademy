# 🎓 Teaching Guide: How to Record & Structure Your AI Course

This guide walks you through how to teach each lesson, what to show on screen, and how to engage students.

---

## 📐 Lesson Structure Template

Every lesson should follow this structure:

```
1. HOOK (10-30 seconds)
   → Show the finished result immediately
   → "By the end of this lesson, you'll have built [X]"

2. CONTEXT (1-2 minutes)
   → Why does this matter?
   → Where does this fit in the bigger picture?

3. DEMONSTRATION (Main content, 5-15 minutes)
   → Build it live with AI
   → Think out loud
   → Keep mistakes - they're valuable

4. CHALLENGE (30 seconds)
   → Give them something to build solo
   → Simple variation of what you just taught

5. PREVIEW (10 seconds)
   → Quick tease of next lesson
```

## 📚 WEB COURSE: Lesson-by-Lesson Teaching Guide

### Module 1: The AI Mindset

#### Lesson 1.1: Welcome & Course Overview
**Goal:** Get them excited and set expectations

**Script Outline:**
- Open with a quick montage of finished projects they'll build
- Introduce yourself briefly (30 sec max)
- Show the course roadmap
- Emphasize: "You don't need any experience - just follow along"

**Screen Recording:**
- Show completed projects (websites, apps)
- Display course structure diagram
- End on the Cursor IDE download page

---

#### Lesson 1.2: Setting Up Cursor IDE
**Goal:** Get their development environment ready

**Script Outline:**
- "Let's set up your coding environment in 5 minutes"
- Walk through download and install
- Show the key features of Cursor
- Make a simple "Hello World" with AI

**Screen Recording:**
- cursor.sh download
- Installation process
- First AI chat interaction
- Write simple HTML file with AI help

**Pro Tip:** Move slowly here. Beginners get lost on setup.

#### Lesson 1.3: Prompt Engineering Basics
**Goal:** Teach them how to "talk" to AI effectively

**Key Points to Cover:**
1. Be specific with your requests
2. Provide context (what you're building)
3. Ask for explanations, not just code
4. Iterate - first answer isn't always best

**Examples to Show:**
```
❌ Bad: "Make a button"
✅ Good: "Create a blue button that says 'Submit' with rounded corners and a hover effect that makes it slightly darker"

❌ Bad: "Fix this"
✅ Good: "This code should show a popup when clicked, but nothing happens. Here's my code: [code]. What's wrong?"
```

**Exercise:** Have them write 3 prompts and improve each one.

---

#### Lesson 1.4: Your First AI-Assisted Code
**Goal:** Build something real with AI in under 10 minutes

**Project:** Simple calculator webpage

**Script Outline:**
- "Let's build something you can actually use"
- Open Cursor, start with blank HTML file
- Ask AI: "Create a simple calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
- Customize it (different colors, bigger buttons)
- Open in browser

**Key Teaching Moments:**
- Show how to ask for modifications
- Explain the code briefly (don't go deep)
- Celebrate the win: "You just built your first app!"

---

### Module 2: Zero to One

#### Lesson 2.1: HTML Basics with AI
**Goal:** Understand HTML structure without memorizing

**Approach:**
- Don't teach HTML traditionally
- Instead, ask AI to build things and explain

**Demo Script:**
- "Let's understand what AI is actually creating"
- Build a simple bio page
- As you go, pause and explain: headers, paragraphs, links, images
- Show how to inspect elements in browser

**Visual:** Use browser DevTools to show HTML structure

---

#### Lesson 2.2: CSS Styling with AI
**Goal:** Make things beautiful without memorizing properties

**Project:** Style the bio page from Lesson 2.1

**Demo Script:**
- "Now let's make this look professional"
- Ask AI for modern styling
- Tweak colors, fonts, spacing
- Add hover effects

**Key Prompts to Show:**
- "Make this look like a modern professional website"
- "Use a dark theme with blue accents"
- "Add smooth hover effects to all buttons"

---

#### Lesson 2.3: Building a Landing Page
**Goal:** Create a complete, professional landing page

**Project:** Personal portfolio or business landing page

**Live Demo:**
- Start from scratch
- Build section by section:
  1. Hero section with headline
  2. About section
  3. Services/Features
  4. Contact section
  5. Footer

**Teaching Points:**
- How to think in sections
- Mobile responsiveness
- Call-to-action buttons

**Challenge:** Customize it for their own portfolio

---

#### Lesson 2.4: Deploy to the World
**Goal:** Put their site online for free

**Demo:**
- Create Vercel account
- Connect to GitHub (or use CLI)
- Deploy in 2 minutes
- Show the live URL

**Celebrate:** "You now have a live website. Show your friends!"

---

### Module 3: JavaScript & Interactivity
(Continue this pattern...)

## 📱 MOBILE COURSE: Key Teaching Differences

### Important Notes for Mobile Course:
1. **Setup is harder** - Spend extra time on React Native setup
2. **Testing is different** - Show Expo Go app on phone
3. **Navigation is mobile-specific** - Dedicate time to this
4. **Touch vs Click** - Call out the differences

---

## 🎯 Teaching Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Show results first, explain later
- ✅ Make intentional mistakes and debug with AI
- ✅ Keep videos under 15 minutes
- ✅ Use your real voice, not a script-read voice
- ✅ Celebrate small wins often
- ✅ Provide downloadable code for each lesson

### DON'T:
- ❌ Spend time on theory without practice
- ❌ Assume they remember previous lessons
- ❌ Skip over "obvious" steps
- ❌ Use jargon without explaining it
- ❌ Make it perfect - authenticity wins

## 💡 Engagement Techniques

1. **Pattern Interrupt:** Every 2-3 minutes, change something (zoom, new tab, live preview)

2. **Foreshadowing:** "This will be important later when we..."

3. **Callbacks:** "Remember when we did X? Now we're using it here"

4. **Questions:** "What do you think will happen if...?" (rhetorical)

5. **Progress Check:** "Look how far we've come! We now have..."
