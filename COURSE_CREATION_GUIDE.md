### Key Principles
- **Show the result FIRST** - Start every video showing what you'll build
- **Keep videos SHORT** - Aim for 5-15 minutes each
- **One concept per video** - Don't overload learners
- **End with action items** - Tell them what to practice

## 2. Recording Setup

### Software Options

#### Screen Recording
| Software | Platform | Price | Best For |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **OBS Studio** | All | Free | Budget option |
| **Screen Studio** | Mac | $89 | Smooth zoom effects |
| **Camtasia** | Win/Mac | $250 | All-in-one solution |
| **Loom** | All | Free-$15/mo | Quick tutorials |

#### My Recommendation
Start with **OBS Studio** (free) and upgrade to **Screen Studio** (Mac) or **Camtasia** (Windows) when you're ready. These add automatic zoom effects that make your videos look professional.

### Screen Resolution
- Record at **1920x1080** (1080p) or **2560x1440** (1440p)
- Export at **1920x1080** for best balance of quality/file size
- Use dark mode in your code editor

### Recording Settings (OBS)
```
Video:
- Base Resolution: 1920x1080
- Output Resolution: 1920x1080
- FPS: 60 (or 30 for smaller files)

Audio:
- Sample Rate: 48 kHz
- Channels: Stereo

Output:
- Format: MKV (convert to MP4 after)
- Encoder: x264 or NVENC
- Bitrate: 6000-8000 Kbps
```

## 3. Equipment

### Audio (MOST IMPORTANT)
Bad audio = unwatchable video. This is where you should invest first.

| Level | Option | Price |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Budget | **Phone voice recording** (sync later) | Free |
| Good | **Fifine K669/T669** | $30-40 |
| Better | **Blue Yeti** | $100-130 |
| Best | **Rode PodMic + Interface** | $200+ |

**Free audio fix**: Upload any audio to [Adobe Podcast Enhance](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance) - it removes background noise and improves clarity using AI.

### Camera (Optional but Nice)
For "talking head" videos where you appear on screen:

| Level | Option |
|-------|--------|
| Budget | Laptop webcam |
| Good | Your phone (iPhone/Android) |
| Better | Logitech C920/C922 |
| Best | Sony ZV-1 / Mirrorless |

**Tip**: You can record yourself on your phone and overlay it as a small circle in the corner of your screen recording.

### Lighting
- Natural window light (free, best option)
- Ring light ($20-50) for consistent lighting
- Face the light source, don't have it behind you

## 4. Recording Tips

### Before Recording
1. **Plan your script** - Outline key points (don't read word-for-word)
2. **Clean your desktop** - Hide notifications, close unnecessary apps
3. **Prepare code snippets** - Have any starting code ready
4. **Test audio levels** - Record 30 seconds and check

### During Recording
1. **Speak clearly and slightly slower** than normal
2. **Don't be afraid of mistakes** - Show how you debug with AI
3. **Think out loud** - Explain your decision-making process
4. **Move your mouse slowly** - Viewers need to follow
5. **Pause between sections** - Makes editing easier

### The "Anti-Boring" Method
- ❌ Don't: Spend 10 minutes setting up
- ✅ Do: Show the finished result in the first 10 seconds
- ❌ Don't: Type every character manually
- ✅ Do: Use AI to generate, then explain and customize
- ❌ Don't: Edit out ALL mistakes
- ✅ Do: Keep mistakes that show debugging process

### Recording Script Template
```
[0:00-0:10] Hook
"By the end of this video, you'll have built [RESULT]"

[0:10-0:30] Show the Result
[Screen recording of the finished product]

[0:30-1:00] Quick overview
"Here's what we'll cover..."

[1:00-END] The Tutorial
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Explain WHY, not just HOW
- End with a challenge for the viewer
```

### Quick Edit Workflow
